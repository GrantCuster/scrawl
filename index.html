I'm working on a new build system for our Fast Forward reports. Previously, we have been writing in Asciidoc. That gets converted to HTML via Pandoc and inserted into a Django template. It works partly through an Asciidoc configuration file with a bunch of trial-and-error-based hacks that I never felt comfortable with. I have long wanted to revamp this but it's taken me a while to figure out exactly what I wanted to do.

So far, in the new system we write in markdown. The report gets built using node and a markdown renderer called markdown-it. Markdown-it had enough plugins/rendering flexibility to get almost all the features we regularly used in Asciidoc (table of contents, figure captions, an info box). The output is much cleaner and I understand the system much better (it's still on my list to understand the markdown-it configuration options better, though).

The markdown render gets put together with HTML and and CSS via a node build file. The process of manipulating (reading, writing, moving) files through a build script is new to me, and it feels great to have that control. I discovered the techniques looking at build processes for Next.js static blogs. The file has gotten messy as I've added more CSS and some javscript. But it still feels great to know exactly the relationship between the code going in and the code generated. I also get to carry over some of the style stuff I've built up from React, where I set a unit for line-height and then can use that for spacing math in both the CSS and the element style options.

My end goal for this is for us to be able to publish research and feel very confident in the presentation. Another big part of this is communicating the available content styles to the rest of the team. A constrained and understood style space is going to ensure there are no rendering surprises. It will also make it easier for everyone to write. I often think back to the title of the article "When I sit down at my text editor I feel calm". That is a big part of the goal. That everyone can sit down and do the work of thinking and writing and feel confident in their tools. Having the tools be understandable (so the user can maintain a mental model of what's going to happen in their head, and feel confindent about it) is, I think, a key part of reaching that feeling.

This is an area I've returned to again and again in my work. I'm thinking about whether and how it could be turned into a career. What is it exactly? Is it just building a CMS? I think what I want to make are content systems. So content strategy is in there. And I also want to build the (simple) tools. And then part of the tool constraints should be tied to the branding, which I'd also like to develop. So that's a lot! Or would I like to make the system that lets other people make these systems?

I have an idea for a writing system where I just describe the things around me (basically like doing a sketch from life everyday but for writing: "My computer is sitting on a brown, wooden table. The table is covered in tan scratches, mostly in the middle and around the edges. I have a small coffee in a cup on a saucer. The coffee is a shade of tan in-between the colors of the scratches and the table."). I wonder what that interface and presentation should look like? Should I also actually draw the scene, and present the sketch along with the words? That seems like an interesting project but the drawing would make the writing somewhat irrelevant.

The ambitious idea of for the observation-write presentation is to use some of the <a href="https://observablehq.com/@grantcuster/text-portrait" target="_blank">ASCII art experiments</a> I've done, and take a picture of the scene, that then gets rendered using only the letters from the description. I think this is a cool idea, but it might have too many fiddly aspects to start with.

More presentation ideas:
- Take a picture, threshold it, the writing can only go in the black areas.
- Use GPS coordinates to position the writing on a map.
- Use something like the concept of a GPS map but more abstract. Something that combines actual geographic space with mental space.
- Sometimes I'll write about large stuff, like buildings or skylines, and sometimes small stuff, like the dust on a chair in front of me. Is there some way I can represent that difference in scale in the interface and presentation.
- Do something generative combining the time of day I wrote it and the geographic location (to set something like background color).
- Track my eyes as I look around, then make a drawing of how my gaze moved as I wrote.

Of those, I think something that represents the different scale of the writing sounds the most promising. It has the feel of a presentation conceit with a meaningful connection to the content, where I'd actually be interested in getting a feel for how much I describe small stuff versus large stuff (compared to time of day or location, which for me would be pretty same-y day-to-day). But what is the way to present that that is noticeable but not overwhelming? Something with bigger and smaller font-size is what I first think of. Hard to that do without being really distracting, though. It would be cool to have a 3d interface where the text is positioned in space. And then maybe the closer stuff could actually be writing positioned closer to the viewer. But I also want the entries to be arranged reversed-chronologically, how do I merge those two overlapping organization systems?

For awhile, instead of <a href="https://constraint.systems" target="_blank">constraint systems</a>, I thought I'd do writing systems, and it would be a series of different writing interfaces + sites. The interfaces and the presentation would reflect different writing intentions. One for stream-of-consciousness notes, one a level of polish on top of that (or maybe a level of structure), and one fully polished. The idea is to experiment with how interfaces and presentation can make expression easier. 

Scrawl is a version of the unpolished app and so far I would say the experiment is going OK? It is easier for me to write here knowing the expectations I have set for myself is that it will be unpolished. It will be interesting to see when/if I structure this stuff up into something more polished. I might need to make some sort of external commitment (maybe a talk?) to make sure I get that done at some point.

One piece that is not in place yet is a system for creating sketches or graphics along with this content. I would like to make an app where you could switch into drawing mode at a similar fidelity to the level you're writing at. That's partly what some of the constraint system drawing apps could become -- you could write a paragraph, switch to drawing mode, and a keyboard-editable canvas would be dropped in. There too, I would try to productively limit options so that you have what you need to get a concept across visually, but not to fiddle beyond that. Draw quickly, and switch back over to writing. The idea is to keep you in flow. (It might be a keyboard-based diagram-ish thing or it might be that you can switch to free-hand drawing and it's just the stroke is big enough to convey that this is a rough sketch.)

I'm going to keep experimenting. I'll keep running scrawl and see how that feels. I'll think about what it could look like to take some of these scrawl notes and structure them up. And I'll keep experimenting with the drawing tools at constraint systems. And maybe at some point they'll merge.

I think I know what branding is now. Mostly I've been thinking about interfaces lately, but as we rethink the Fast Forward branding to better fit within Cloudera, I've been thinking again about just what branding is and does. Part of my recent thoughts are based off Ben Pieratt's <a href="https://twitter.com/pieratt/status/1184178822410883072" target="_blank">Pre-Brand</a> concept and discussing the idea with some co-workers.

I'm especially thinking about <a href="https://twitter.com/pieratt/status/1184179407302332417" target="_blank">this slide</a>, which diagrams how a start-up may disregard several early identities before settling on a stable identity. The diagram is missing some things that I think are implicit in the rest of idea, but not drawn out. I think the diagram should be more zig-zaggy, and the branding is a marker for where the group wants to go. And it travels along the path towards the idea in that brand for a while, before reorienting towards a different idea, discovered during the work on the previous. Maybe sometimes the course is reversed, but mostly it's probably a zig-zag, where you keep moving in one general direction even as you zig-zag to get there.

Writing that, it's fun to see how much the idea of a 'problem space' has influenced my thinking. How much I tend to see things according to that lens now.

But the thing I want to emphasize, when I look at the proposed pre-brand process, is that the three developed concepts are not just things that might or might not fit. They're looks at what a start-up could be. They're all illuminating different positions within a problem space, and because the start-up being made is moving and developing, they're going to influence that development just by being known and seen.

Of course the brand here is just one aspect in the multi-dimensional stew of how the start-up is going to develop and what it is going to be. That course of development is being pulled along by a lot of other forces, but the brand influences some of those directions.

An early brand is a cultural marker for where you want to meet your users and audience. It stakes out a place for the company in relation to other markers.

I think the new thing that I am starting to believe is how important the brand can be to the start-up itself, to the people working there. In early days, it's probably more important for them than the audience. It can be a reminder as you're doing the mundane, everyday stuff, that this is all working towards something bigger. The brand can be a visual slot for the workers to put all their associations and aspirations for what the work could be. I think this makes me feel better about the usefulness of branding, although of course in that function it could be put to good/mixed/evil use depending on the work.

Scrawl is a new project where I try and write my notes quickly, without much editing. Eventually I hope a lot of this will feed into more polished writing elsewhere. I've been thinking about doing this for a while. Lately, I've been excited about some of the work I've been doing with <a href="https://constraint.systems" target="_blank">Constraint Systems</a> and some of the connections I'm making between ideas in my head, but I want to do a better job of exploring some of those ideas with other people. And I'm pretty sure that means writing.

I have some other places for writing, but for a while I've been playing with the idea of a site where the stated purpose is unpolished notes. It's an opportunity to try out some of the constraint design concepts I've been thinking about. The basic idea is that by providing a constrained tool, you free people to express themselves more because you can't distract yourself with formatting decisions. This is closely connected with an idea of staying in flow.

So for this site the posts are run off text files. There's no headings, and there's basically just paragraphs (it actually uses the 'pre-wrap' whitespace setting to preserve the formatting from the text file, which leaves open some opportunities for stuff like formatting a basic text list). There are no images. I can put in links using markdown syntax. I want to write basically stream-of-consciousness and see how things develop. Files are titled according to the date and "hour quarter", where the day is split up into 96 (24 * 4) hour quarters: <a href="https://observablehq.com/@grantcuster/quarters" target="_blank">as shown here</a>.

Hopefully, this serves as a sort of companion to my <a href="http://feed.grantcuster.com" target="_blank">feed</a>. I think my feed has weirdly been one of my most successful product designs, and that is almost all down to constraints. Specifically, how the constraints make it easier and clear for me to post. One screenshot (or GIF) plus text. A few times I added the ability to do video or quote, but those options are mostly unused now. The goal above all was just to do something where I post. The syndication to Twitter and Mastodon have also been helpful for getting feedback from others. I should probably set up a similar system here. Anyway, I think one of the main things lacking in feed has been context. It's fun to post little cryptic messages, and not needing to explain the background of everything has certainly made it easier to post, but I do want to do more writing and thinking through of my ideas. So now there is scrawl, which is a kind of variation on feed.

All of this stuff is exploratory and provisional. One thing I am pretty sure of, though, is that making different parts as new, separate projects, that live in their own repo and then get a fun subdomain is a great way to do side projects. It hits the right spot for me of forcing me to get it into a releasable state but not a perfectly polished, final state. This is one thing, it's here, I might do a different version but it will be something else, not an update to this one. There is a definite influence there from the idea of immutability in programming and stuff like immutable deploys in Zeit's Now. One of the things I definitely want to write about here is how programming concepts are influencing how I think about design and just process in general.
