Rough music purchasing plan:

I've been meaning to switch off Spotify to bandcamp, but unsure about how to start the transition. So I'm planning a system.

I keep listening to Spotify, tracking what I listen to using last.fm. At the end of each month I buy three albums.

Which albums I buy is based on a combination of:
  what I listen to the most +
  bias toward active artists (release in the past two years?) +
  bias towards less popular artists (probably using a threshold of global plays on spotify or last.fm) +
  available to buy on bandcamp.

Maybe I'll make a script to calculate this for myself.
